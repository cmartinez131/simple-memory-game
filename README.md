## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

A challenge I encountered was working with a fairly new coding language. I have used html and css for my personal portfolio and have seen javascript before but I haven't worked with JavaScript before. Using DOMs was new to me and it was interesting to learn. At first I didn't understand right away how the built in JavaScipt DOMs worked so I looked at the documentation and played around with different inputs. Another challenge I saw was when I was writing the functions to play the sound and the sound didn't play for some of the buttons. I was stuck for about 30 minutes until I realized that it wasn't the play sound function that had the problem, it was because I had one button set to a different sound. It was challenging when I had to fix an error but didn't get an error message. I eventually reread my code slowly to find the bug which was a single character.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- How do projects scale into something that can reach a lot of people? What are the limits of web development? 
- How can I write cleaner code? I already noticed that my CSS file was getting cluttered when designing the buttons and I am looking forward to learning more about how code is designed and made to scale as projects get bigger.
- How are bigger projects with multiple people working on it managed? I imagine there are lots of merge conflicts and when teams work together.
- How does web development fit into a business?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would start by changing the buttons to images. I think having just the colors light up are pretty boring. I would put interesting images, like animals and make the sounds animal noises instead of different frequencies. When I let someone play it, they said that the sounds were pretty boring so I would change it to make the user experience more entertaining. I would have a button that would activate different game modes, for example having a hard difficutly version that has the sounds speed up as you progress in the game. I think people would be more likely to enjoy playing it if it were more challenging and interesting graphics. There is already a function that holds the sounds, so I assume I would just have to find a package that has sounds I want and put it in this function. Maybe I can also make use of the "hidden" feature that was in one of the instructions to make some of the squares dissapear every turn. This will add to the difficulty.
